# Flight Delay Prediction

[![Lint](https://github.com/NikhilJairaj26/Flight-delay-prediction/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NikhilJairaj26/Flight-delay-prediction/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

Predict whether a flight will be delayed (yes/no) using historical features like time of day, route, and weather. Clean features in, clear predictions out — with simple training and inference commands.

## Features
- Supervised classification to predict delay vs no-delay.
- Feature engineering from timestamps (hour, day-of-week), routes (origin–destination), and weather fields.
- Evaluation with ROC/PR curves, confusion matrix, and calibrated thresholds.
- Reproducible pipeline with requirements, scripts, and example notebooks.
